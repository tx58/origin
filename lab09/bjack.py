"""
A module for a very simple approximation of the game Blackjack

provided in the card module.

class Blackjack(object):

    A class representing the state of a game of blackjack with one player.

    INSTANCE ATTRIBUTES:
        playerHand: list of the Cards held by the player [list of Cards]
        dealerHand: list of the Cards held by the dealer [list of Cards]
        deck: list of the remaining Cards to draw from   [list of Cards]

    The deck attribute is assumed to hold enough Cards for the game
    to be able to run to completion (i.e. the deck wil not run out
    of cards for the player or dealer to draw).

    To simplify this lab, we allow direct access to the attributes, even
    though that is bad practice.  See the Card class for the proper way
    to protect attributes.

        These three cards are removed from deck.

        Deck is a parameter because we allow the caller, such as a casino,
        to "stack the deck" (choose the arrangement of the cards, insert
        extra cards,etc.) to its advantage!
